# Hey, I'm D-Jay (DJDlauzy)! üëã :3

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a digital design enthusiast who loves creating sleek, pixel-perfect visuals. I‚Äôm all about crafting clean, structured web pages with **HTML**‚Äîit‚Äôs my go-to for building the foundation of my designs. Coding-wise, Python and I are *not* besties. üòÖ I suck at it, but I use AI to make my Python code look *readable* and somewhat legit.
